Not sure if this will help, but I have my older Pi's setup this way so I only get my splash screen, no text or anything else.

From a terminal window, type the following:
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Replace console=tty1 with console=tty3 to redirect boot messages to the third console.
at the end of the line, add loglevel=3 to disable non-critical kernel log messages.

Hide the logo by adding: logo.nologo
Hide the flashing _ text cursor by adding vt.global_cursor_default=0

The line should look like this:

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty3 root=/devmmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait loglevel=3 logo.nologo vt.global_cursor_default=0

Hide mouse cursor
==============
To hide the mouse cursor on inactivity open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi, type the following:
sudo apt-get install unclutter

Disable Sleep Screen
================
To force the screen to stay on you need to do the following, this will prevent the screen from going blank after 15 minutes.

From a terminal window, type the following:
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

Add the following lines to the [SeatDefaults] section:
# don't sleep the screen
xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

Hope this helps, I've used this on my Pi's to load straight into a refreshing web browser (additional steps required for loading browser not listed here), but it essentially removes anything thats annoying except for my custom splash screen and the webpage that loads.
